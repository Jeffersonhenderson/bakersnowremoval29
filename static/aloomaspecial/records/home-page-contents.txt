It snowed heavily overnight, and I was worried my customers wouldn’t even be able to get into my restaurant for breakfast. I called Snow Removal #State around 5 a.m., and by 6:30 they showed up. In less than an hour they had my parking lot and all the walkways completely cleared. Super quick, professional service. I’ll keep recommending Snow Removal #State to anyone who needs snow removal.<h2>- John Moore
